# Cross-Tool Evidence Enrichment (Multi-Source Synthesis)

**Use Case:** Complex analysis commands that can pull context from multiple upstream systems and push outputs to multiple downstream systems simultaneously.

## The Core Mechanic

When defining the `## If Connectors Available` section, do not write generic "use tools if available" blocks. Instead, explicitly assign one of three distinct **roles** to each tool category in the synthesis pipeline: Source, Validator, or Publisher.

### Implementation Standard

1. **Source (Input Enrichment)**: Pulls data to build the foundation.
   ```markdown
   If **~~user feedback** is connected:
   - Pull the last 30 days of support tickets to supplement interview data.
   ```

2. **Validator (Cross-Reference)**: Used to verify qualitative claims against quantitative metrics.
   ```markdown
   If **~~product analytics** is connected:
   - Validate qualitative "difficulty" findings by checking actual task completion rates.
   ```

3. **Publisher (Output Routing)**: Automates the "next step" actionability of the report.
   ```markdown
   If **~~project tracker** is connected:
   - Create individual tickets for each 🔴 Critical finding identified above.
   ```
