# Optimization Program: os-improvement-loop

Goal: maximize `quality_score` (higher is better, max 1.0).

Formula: `quality_score = (routing_accuracy * 0.7) + (heuristic_score * 0.3)`

- `routing_accuracy`: fraction of evals.json prompts correctly matched against
  the mutation target's frontmatter content
- `heuristic_score`: structural health check (description length, example blocks, trigger coverage)
- KEEP requires: `score >= baseline AND f1 >= baseline_f1`
  (dual guard prevents metric gaming: padding increases recall but drops precision/F1)

Mutation target: `SKILL.md` — you may ONLY edit this file each iteration.
One focused change per iteration. No bulk rewrites.

Locked (never modify during the loop):
- `scripts/evaluate.py`
- `scripts/eval_runner.py`
- `evals/evals.json`

How to run one iteration:
1. Edit `SKILL.md` (one focused change to description, triggers, or examples)
2. `python scripts/evaluate.py --skill . --desc "what you changed"`
3. If KEEP (exit 0): `git add SKILL.md && git commit -m "keep: score=X <description>"`
4. If DISCARD (exit 1): evaluate.py already reverted `SKILL.md` automatically

NEVER STOP. Run until manually interrupted or target score is reached.

## Notes

- **What is being optimized**: Routing accuracy — ensuring os-improvement-loop triggers on
  concurrent multi-agent coordination requests and NOT on single-agent tasks like learning-loop,
  eval-runner, or memory-manager (which share some vocabulary)
- **Target score**: 0.90
- **Max iterations**: 30
- **Baseline established**: <!-- filled in by evaluate.py --baseline -->
- **Key adversarial risk**: "run the learning loop", "evaluate this skill", "write a memory log"
  share vocabulary with this skill's description but should NOT trigger it
