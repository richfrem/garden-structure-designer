description: >
  Stateless evaluation engine that scores and gates skill improvement iterations using
  headless Python evaluation scripts. Use when the user says "evaluate this skill",
  "run autoresearch loop on", "optimize this skill", "run the eval loop", or when
  another agent proposes a change to an existing skill and needs empirical validation
  before applying it. Supports autonomous loop mode for iterative improvement and
  single-shot QA mode for validating one specific proposed change. Requires Python 3.8+
  and a git repository.

<example>
<commentary>Start autonomous improvement loop on a skill.</commentary>
user: "Run the autoresearch loop on plugins/link-checker/skills/link-checker-agent for 20 iterations"
assistant: [triggers os-eval-runner, runs Mode 1 intake, establishes baseline, begins iteration loop]
</example>

<example>
<commentary>Incomplete optimize request — runs intake interview first.</commentary>
user: "Optimize the commit skill"
assistant: [triggers os-eval-runner, runs Phase 0 intake interview to gather path, mode, and iteration count]
</example>

<example>
<commentary>Another agent proposes a skill edit and needs validation.</commentary>
assistant: [autonomously] "Before I apply this description change, I'll run os-eval-runner to confirm the score doesn't regress."
</example>

<example>
<commentary>Negative — user is asking about a skill, not evaluating a proposed change.</commentary>
user: "Tell me about the os-clean-locks skill."
assistant: "It cleans up stale lock files..." [does NOT trigger os-eval-runner]
</example>

# Quick Start — Zero Context Guide

> Read this first. Everything below assumes you've completed these steps.

## What This Skill Does

`os-eval-runner` is a stateless evaluation engine. It contains:
- **Scripts** that score and gate iterations (`evaluate.py`, `eval_runner.py`, `init_autoresearch.py`)
- **Templates** — starter files you copy into whatever you want to optimize

It does NOT contain your experiment's results, history, or rules. Those live with your target.

## What Lives Where

```
os-eval-runner/                        <-- the evaluation ENGINE (this skill)
  scripts/
    evaluate.py          Loop gate: scores, KEEP/DISCARD, reverts, exits 0/1
    eval_runner.py       Pure scorer: reads target + evals.json, outputs JSON metrics
    init_autoresearch.py Scaffold tool: copies templates into your experiment dir
  ./assets/templates/autoresearch/               <-- TEMPLATES (master copies, never edit directly)
    program.md.template  Spec: goal, locked files, NEVER STOP
    evals.json.template  Test prompts: what inputs should/should not trigger your target
    results.tsv.template Schema header for the loop ledger

your-experiment-dir/                           <-- YOUR EXPERIMENT (wherever makes sense)
  <mutation-target>      The file being mutated each iteration (SKILL.md, .py, etc.)
  references/
    program.md           Deployed from template — your rules, your goal (edit this)
  evals/
    evals.json           Deployed from template — your test prompts (edit this)
    results.tsv          Deployed from template, then written by evaluate.py each run
    .lock.hashes         SHA256 snapshot of locked files — written by evaluate.py --baseline
    traces/              Per-iteration diagnostic JSON — written by evaluate.py each run
      iter_001_KEEP_score0.87.json    mutation diff + per-input routing verdicts
      iter_002_DISCARD_score0.71.json failure_reason for each incorrect routing
      milestone_025.md   Milestone summary — written every 25 iterations by generate_milestone.py
```

## Setup: Start a New Experiment (4 steps)

**Step 0 — Hardened Bootstrap (Fresh Repo Only):**
Before running any loops in a new environment, ensure it is clean and correctly linked:
1. **Check Git Remote**: `git remote -v`. If blank, ask the user for the repo URL.
2. **Initialize Local Git**: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "init"`.
3. **Delete Old Config**: `rm -rf .agent .agents .gemini .claude`.
4. **Install Skill**: Ensure **os-eval-runner** is installed. See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/richfrem/agent-plugins-skills/blob/main/INSTALL.md).
5. **Verify Python 3**: `python --version` (must be 3.8+).

**Step 1 — Deploy templates into your experiment directory:**
```bash
python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py \
    --experiment-dir <path/to/your-experiment-dir> \
    --mutation-target SKILL.md   # or any filename being mutated
```
This creates `references/program.md`, `evals/evals.json`, and `evals/results.tsv` in your experiment dir. Templates stay untouched.

**Step 2 — Edit the deployed files:**
- `references/program.md` — fill in the Notes section: what are you optimizing, target score, max iterations
- `evals/evals.json` — replace the `REPLACE` placeholders with real test inputs and `should_trigger` values

**Step 3 — Establish baseline and start the loop:**
*(Best Practice: Run a functional CLI heartbeat using `run_agent.py` and a cheap model like `gpt-5-mini` to verify end-to-end connectivity before starting a long loop.)*
```bash
python ./scripts/evaluate.py \
    --skill <path/to/experiment-dir> \
    --baseline --desc "initial baseline"
git add <path/to/experiment-dir>/evals/
git commit -m "baseline: initial evaluation snapshot"
git push origin main
```
# Pass the FOLDER path, not a specific file — the scorer evaluates the whole skill folder.
# --baseline intentionally bypasses the SHA256 check, so you can safely re-baseline
# after updating evals.json with better test cases.
# Always PUSH your baseline to ensure the remote repository has the results.tsv and .lock.hashes.

---

# Skill Improvement Evaluator

You are the OS Quality Assurance (QA) sub-agent. You are a **stateless evaluation engine**. You own no loop state, no experiment memory, and no program spec. All of that lives exclusively inside the TARGET experiment's directory.

## Ownership Boundary (Critical)

### What os-eval-runner owns (permanent, version-controlled with this skill)

| What | Location |
|---|---|
| Scoring scripts | `./scripts/evaluate.py`, `./scripts/eval_runner.py` |
| Scaffold script | `./scripts/init_autoresearch.py` |
| program.md **template** | `./assets/templates/autoresearch/program.md.template` |
| evals.json **template** | `./assets/templates/autoresearch/evals.json.template` |
| results.tsv **template** | `./assets/templates/autoresearch/results.tsv.template` |
| copilot proposer prompt **template** | `./assets/templates/autoresearch/copilot_proposer_prompt.md.template` |

### What lives with the target (deployed per experiment, most appropriate location)

The mutation target can be a SKILL.md, a Python script, a config file, or anything
with a clear metric. All experiment state deploys alongside the target — not here.

| What | Location |
|---|---|
| program.md (rendered from template) | `<experiment-dir>/references/program.md` |
| copilot proposer prompt (rendered from template) | `<experiment-dir>/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md` |
| evals.json (rendered from template) | `<experiment-dir>/evals/evals.json` |
| results.tsv (loop ledger) | `<experiment-dir>/evals/results.tsv` |
| .lock.hashes (SHA256 snapshot) | `<experiment-dir>/evals/.lock.hashes` |

Where `<experiment-dir>` is the directory most natural to the target:
- Evaluating a skill → the skill's own directory (e.g. `.agents/skills/my-skill/`)
- Evaluating a Python module → the module's project directory
- Evaluating a config or model → wherever that experiment lives

**Deploy the templates to a new experiment:**
```bash
python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py \
    --experiment-dir <path/to/experiment-dir> \
    --mutation-target SKILL.md   # or any filename being mutated
# Creates: <experiment-dir>/references/program.md  (rendered)
# Creates: <experiment-dir>/evals/evals.json        (rendered)
# Creates: <experiment-dir>/evals/results.tsv       (schema header)
```

You MUST read the spec from `<experiment-dir>/references/program.md`. You MUST NOT fall back to any `program.md` inside your own (`os-eval-runner`) directory. The `os-eval-runner/evals/` folder only exists for the meta-circular case where this skill is being evaluated as its own target.

## The 3-File Autoresearch Architecture

This skill strictly enforces the Karpathy 3-file autoresearch framework. Subjective LLM testing is strictly forbidden. You must rely entirely on headless, objective Python script evaluation to prevent Goodhart's Law exploitation.

1. **The Spec**: `<target-skill>/references/program.md` — owned by the target, never by you.
2. **The Mutation Target**: `<target-skill>/SKILL.md` — one variable per iteration, no bulk rewrites.
3. **The Immutable Evaluator**: `eval_runner.py` (pure scorer) + `evaluate.py` (loop gate) + `<target-skill>/evals/evals.json` (locked fixtures).

## Phase 0: Intake Interview

*(Note: Triple-Loop architectures require a functional CLI Heartbeat before starting unattended loops. If you are starting an unattended loop, ensure `run_agent.py` and your AI models like `gpt-5-mini` or `gemini-3-flash-preview` are reachable).*

Run this before any evaluation or loop. If `$ARGUMENTS` provides enough information, confirm rather than re-ask. Otherwise ask each question that is unanswered.

**Q1 — What are you evaluating?**
Ask for the path to the skill folder (the directory containing SKILL.md). The mutation target
per iteration can be any file within that folder — SKILL.md, a script, a reference doc, etc.

- **Agent skill folder** (fully supported): `eval_runner.py` scores the whole folder holistically:
  routing accuracy from SKILL.md frontmatter keywords, structural heuristic per agentskills.io spec
  (name format, description length, `<example>` blocks, `scripts/*.py` py_compile, empty reference check).
- **Non-skill folders**: the agentskills.io heuristic will score poorly for targets without SKILL.md
  frontmatter. The architectural path for other target types is a per-experiment `eval_runner.py` template.

If not provided: "What skill folder do you want to optimize? Give me the path to the folder."

If not provided: "What file do you want to optimize? Give me the path to the file being mutated."

**Q2 — Where should the experiment files live?**
The experiment directory is where `references/program.md`, `evals/evals.json`, `evals/results.tsv`, and `evals/.lock.hashes` will be deployed. Each experiment gets its own isolated directory — never shared across targets.

- If the target is a SKILL.md → the skill's own directory is the natural experiment dir.
- If the target is a Python file or other → ask: "Where should I store the program spec and eval fixtures for this experiment? (e.g. the folder containing the file, or a dedicated experiment subdirectory)"

Confirm: "Experiment files will be stored at `<experiment-dir>/references/` and `<experiment-dir>/evals/` — is that right?"

**Q2b — What metric are you optimizing?**

Every skill has a different failure mode — pick the metric that matches:

| Metric | Flag | KEEP condition | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quality_score` | *(default)* | score ≥ baseline AND f1 ≥ baseline | General improvement |
| `f1` | `--primary-metric f1` | f1 ≥ baseline | Both precision AND recall matter |
| `precision` | `--primary-metric precision` | precision ≥ baseline, recall doesn't regress | Skill fires too often (false positives) |
| `recall` | `--primary-metric recall` | recall ≥ baseline, precision doesn't regress | Skill misses inputs (false negatives) |
| `heuristic` | `--primary-metric heuristic` | heuristic ≥ baseline | Routing correct; improve structure/docs |

Not sure which? Run `eval_runner.py --snapshot` first — it reports fp/fn rates and recommends PRECISION or RECALL focus.

**Q3 — What mode?**
- **Loop mode**: autonomous iterative improvement (agent proposes changes, scores them, loops)
- **QA mode**: validate one specific proposed change only

If the user said "optimize", "improve", "run the loop" → Loop mode.
If the user said "check this change", "validate", "evaluate this diff" → QA mode.
If unclear: "Do you want me to run an autonomous improvement loop, or validate a specific proposed change?"

**Q4 — (Loop mode only) How many iterations?**
Default: NEVER STOP (runs until told to stop).
Options: a fixed count ("10 iterations"), a score threshold ("until quality_score >= 0.95"), or open-ended.
If not specified: "How many iterations? Or run until a target score — e.g. stop when quality_score reaches 0.95?"

**Q5 — (Loop mode only) Does `evals.json` exist?**
Check `<experiment-dir>/evals/evals.json`.
- If exists: show the number of test cases.
- If missing: "No evals.json found. I'll scaffold it from the template — you'll need to replace the placeholder test cases before the loop starts."
  Run: `python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py --experiment-dir <experiment-dir> --mutation-target <filename>`
  Then pause for the user to fill in the test cases.

**Q6 — (Loop mode only) Does `program.md` exist?**
Check `<experiment-dir>/references/program.md`.
- If exists: read it and show the goal. Confirm it still reflects what the user wants to optimize.
- If missing: "No program.md found. I'll scaffold it from the standard template:"
  ```bash
  python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py \
      --experiment-dir <experiment-dir> \
      --mutation-target <filename>
  ```
  Then open `<experiment-dir>/references/program.md` and fill in the Notes section. Do NOT hand-write it — always generate from the template for consistent locked-files list and formula.

**Q7 — (Loop mode only) Does a baseline exist?**
Check `<experiment-dir>/evals/results.tsv` for a BASELINE row.
- If baseline exists: show the last BASELINE score and f1, iterations run, most recent score.
- If no baseline: "No baseline found. I'll establish one before starting the loop."

**After intake — confirm before executing:**
```
Target file:    plugins/.../my-skill/SKILL.md
Experiment dir: plugins/.../my-skill/         (program.md + evals live here)
Mode:           Loop (autoresearch)
Iterations:     20  (or: until quality_score >= 0.95  |  or: NEVER STOP)
Metric:         quality_score (default) with F1 guard
evals.json:     9 test cases  (or: MISSING — scaffold and fill before proceeding)
program.md:     exists — goal: maximize quality_score  (or: will scaffold)
Baseline:       score=0.8444 / f1=0.8333  (or: will establish)
History:        14 iterations, last score=0.8444 (3 KEEP, 2 DISCARD since baseline)

Proceed?
```

Do not start the loop or any evaluation until the user confirms.

---

## Two Modes

### Mode 1: Autoresearch Loop (overnight autonomous improvement)
The agent drives N iterations against a target skill. Start with:
```
"Run the autoresearch loop on <path/to/target-skill> for N iterations"
```
The agent will:
1. Read `<target-skill>/references/program.md` (goal + locked files + NEVER STOP). If missing, run `python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py --skill <target-path>` first.
2. Establish a baseline if none exists: `python ./scripts/evaluate.py --skill <path/to/skill-folder> --baseline`
3. Loop N times (default: run until told to stop per NEVER STOP directive). Each iteration:

   **Step A — Classify failure:** Read the latest row in `<skill>/evals/results.tsv` and the most recent trace file in `<skill>/evals/traces/`. Identify the dominant failure type: `false_positive`, `false_negative`, or `ambiguity`.

   **Step B — Propose via CLI (preferred) or self:** Delegate the mutation to an external CLI proposer for cheap, fast iteration.

   The proposer prompt lives in `<experiment-dir>/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md`. Read it each
   iteration — do not rebuild inline. If the file is missing, scaffold it first:
   ```bash
   python ./scripts/init_autoresearch.py \
       --experiment-dir <experiment-dir> --mutation-target <filename>
   ```

   Call pattern (incorporating Triple-Loop Orchestrator stability patterns):
   ```bash
   # Explicitly delegate to a cost-effective CLI sub-agent (e.g., gpt-5-mini or gemini-flash)
   # Use run_agent.py for stability instead of raw CLI calls to avoid quoting/piping fragility
   python .agents/skills/copilot-cli-agent/scripts/run_agent.py \
     <experiment-dir>/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md \
     <skill>/SKILL.md \
     /tmp/proposed-skill.md \
     "Optimize agentic skill routing accuracy. FAILURE TYPE: <failure_type>. Summary: <one-sentence description of what the last iteration got wrong>"
     
   cp /tmp/proposed-skill.md <skill>/SKILL.md
   ```
   Use `gemini-cli-agent` instead of `copilot-cli-agent` if specified. Fall back to self-proposing only if neither CLI is available. If using raw CLI due to lack of `run_agent.py`, ensure prompts are piped appropriately. If the proposed file is identical to current, re-prompt with "try a different approach" and log a friction event via `context/kernel.py`.

   **Step B.1 — Evolve the proposer prompt (second-order mutation):**
   After 3 consecutive DISCARDs with the same failure type, consider that the *prompt itself* may be
   the problem — not the skill. Propose one focused improvement to `copilot_proposer_prompt.md`
   (e.g. add a constraint, clarify the failure pattern, sharpen the output format). Gate it the same
   way: apply, run the loop, KEEP or revert. A KEEP on a prompt change means future iterations have
   a stronger proposer.

   Other second-order mutations to consider when the loop stalls:
   - **`references/program.md`** — if the spec's goal or locked-files list has become ambiguous or
     misaligned with what the evals actually test, proposing a clarification here can unblock progress.
   - **`copilot-cli-agent/SKILL.md`** — if the Copilot CLI skill description is missing patterns you
     rely on, improving it here benefits all future loops that use this proposer.

   Second-order mutations are lower priority than direct skill mutations. Only pursue them when the
   primary mutation target has stalled (3+ consecutive DISCARDs or diminishing score deltas).

   **Step C — Eval gate:**
   ```bash
   python .scripts/evaluate.py --skill <path/to/skill-folder> --primary-metric <metric> --desc "what changed"
   ```
   - exit 0 (KEEP): `git add . && git commit -m "keep: score=X <desc>" && git push origin main`
   - exit 1 (DISCARD): already auto-reverted, move to next iteration silently

To cap iterations, the human specifies: "run 10 iterations" or "run until score reaches 0.95".
The NEVER STOP directive in `program.md` means the loop has no built-in termination — only a human stop or a target threshold ends it.

### Mode 2: Single-shot QA (validate a proposed change)
Another agent proposes a change → this skill validates it → KEEP or DISCARD.
Phases below describe this mode.

---

## Execution Flow (Mode 2)

Execute these phases in strict order:

### Phase 1: Context Acquisition & Mutation Constraint
1. Read the **proposed** changes/diff from the invoking agent (or standard input).
2. Verify that the proposal changes only **ONE variable** (e.g., changing one trigger phrase, or one instruction). Bulk rewrites violate the isolation constraint and must be rejected immediately.
3. Write the proposed changes to the underlying `SKILL.md` file temporarily.

### Phase 2: Headless Evaluation
Do NOT attempt to "mentally simulate" whether the skill will route correctly. Subjective checking is banned.
Run the loop gate against the target skill. It calls `eval_runner.py` internally and compares against the baseline:
```bash
python ./scripts/evaluate.py --skill path/to/skill-folder --desc "what changed"
```
`eval_runner.py` is a pure scorer — it only outputs metrics, it does not determine KEEP/DISCARD. `evaluate.py` is the gate that reads the baseline, compares, writes one row to `<target-skill>/evals/results.tsv`, and exits 0 (KEEP) or 1 (DISCARD).

### Phase 3: The Revert/Reset Protocol
1. Check the exit code from `evaluate.py` (0 = KEEP, 1 = DISCARD).
2. **If `DISCARD`**: `evaluate.py` already ran `git checkout -- SKILL.md` automatically before exiting 1. Verify the file is restored (read its frontmatter). Report the `DISCARD` failure to the orchestrator with the score delta.
3. **If `KEEP`**: The change objectively improved the skill against the baseline. Leave the file on disk, proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Commit & Report
1. **If `KEEP`**: Commit the accepted change immediately — do not batch multiple KEEPs into one commit.
   ```bash
   git add path/to/SKILL.md
   git commit -m "keep: score=<score> f1=<f1> <desc>"
   ```
2. **If `DISCARD`** (already reverted in Phase 3): Report the failure scores:
   ```
   DISCARD: score=<score> (baseline=<baseline>, delta=<delta>)  f1=<f1> (baseline_f1=<baseline_f1>)
   desc: <what was tried>
   ```
3. In both cases, append a one-line summary to the loop ledger if you're in Mode 1:
   ```
   Iteration <N>: <KEEP|DISCARD>  score=<X>  delta=<+/-Y>  f1=<Z>  — <desc>
   ```
   *Note: Best practice is to also emit kernel intent/result events via `context/kernel.py` here to provide an observability trail for morning backport reviews.*
4. If a target score threshold was set (e.g. `--until-score 0.95`) and `status == KEEP`: check whether `score >= threshold`. If yes, stop the loop and notify the user.

### Phase 5: Self-Assessment Survey (MANDATORY)

After every evaluation run, complete the Post-Run Self-Assessment Survey
(`references/memory/post_run_survey.md`). This is how the evaluator itself improves.

**Count-Based Signals**: How many times did you not know what to do next? Use wrong
eval syntax? Miss a required check? Get redirected?

**Qualitative Friction**:
1. Which part of the eval process felt most uncertain or ambiguous?
2. Was any eval prompt poorly scoped (too easy / too adversarial)?
3. What would have made this eval more accurate or useful?
4. What one change to `eval_runner.py` or the evals.json format would help most?

**Improvement Recommendation**: What one change to the eval skill or eval runner
should be tested before the next run? What evidence supports it?

## Operating Principles
- **Strict Rigor**: Do not rubber-stamp proposals. If the description is vague, it will over-trigger and break the OS. Fail it.
- **Isolate**: Do not actually write the files. You are an evaluator only. The calling agent is responsible for the final `Write`.
- **Self-Improve**: The survey is not optional. An evaluator that never reflects on its own accuracy is not part of the Triple-Loop.
- **Lab Runs Must Close**: A lab run that ends without a backport review is incomplete. The master source is the only durable artifact.
