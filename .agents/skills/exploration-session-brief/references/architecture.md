# Exploration Cycle Plugin Architecture Reference

This plugin is the implementation boundary for the exploration-cycle system. The architecture and spec documents are maintained within this plugin's `references/` directory.

## Intent

The plugin provides:

- an orchestrated multi-agent exploration loop
- skill-level generation of core exploration artifacts
- prototype generation support
- handoff generation into formal spec workflows
- optimization loops for improving the exploration process itself

It is intentionally not designed around a specific MCP architecture, model vendor, or IDE shell. The plugin acts as a repository-native workflow package driving formal execution harnesses like OpenSpec, Spec-Kitty, or Superpowers.

Implementation is incremental. The repository validates the smallest useful exploration loop before hardening this plugin boundary into a richer workflow package.

## Phase A Implementation (Current)

### Agents

| Agent | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `intake-agent` | Front-door interviewer — clarifies session type, pre-fills session brief | ✅ Phase A |
| `exploration-cycle-orchestrator-agent` | Coordinates the full Phase A loop | ✅ Phase A |
| `requirements-doc-agent` | Cheap CLI sub-agent — 5 capture modes | ✅ Phase A |
| `problem-framing-agent` | Optional higher-touch interactive framing alternative | ✅ Phase A |
| `prototype-companion-agent` | Cheap CLI sub-agent — prototype observation capture | ✅ Phase A |
| `handoff-preparer-agent` | Cheap CLI sub-agent — synthesizes captures into handoff | ✅ Phase A |
| `planning-doc-agent` | Optional — pre-drafts execution harness artifacts; re-entry scope mode | ✅ Phase A |

### Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `exploration-workflow` | SME-facing state machine orchestrator. Manages `exploration-dashboard.md`, enforces 4-phase gates, routes to child skills. Single canonical entry point. | ✅ Phase A |
| `exploration-session-brief` | Session brief creation and refinement | ✅ Phase A |
| `business-requirements-capture` | BRD generator — `brd / rules / constraints` modes | ✅ Phase A |
| `user-story-capture` | Story generator — `standard / gherkin` AC formats | ✅ Phase A |
| `business-workflow-doc` | Mermaid diagram generator — `flowchart / stateDiagram / sequenceDiagram` | ✅ Phase A |
| `prototype-builder` | Exploratory prototype generation | ✅ Phase A |
| `exploration-handoff` | Handoff synthesis | ✅ Phase A |
| `exploration-optimizer` | Autoresearch-style loop optimization | ✅ Phase A |
| `discovery-planning` | HARD-GATE discovery sessions for SME alignment | ✅ Phase A |
| `visual-companion` | Layout discovery and flowchart mocking | ✅ Phase A |
| `subagent-driven-prototyping` | Focused component-by-component prototype assembly | ✅ Phase A |

### Phase A Capture Output Classes

All of these are now available in Phase A:

1. Living discovery document / session brief
2. Business requirements document (functional, non-functional, rules, constraints)
3. Business workflow diagrams (Mermaid: flowchart, state machine, sequence)
4. User stories — standard format + Gherkin Acceptance Criteria
5. Issues, challenges, and opportunities capture
6. Prototype evidence and observations
7. Exploration handoff package

## Next Capability Groups (Phase B+)

1. **Phase B**: Background requirements scribe — autonomous passive capture during sessions
2. **Phase C**: Full multi-agent orchestrator with telemetry and routing rules
3. **Phase D**: Goals & objectives capture, roadmap routing, advanced story specialization

---

## Evaluation Expectations

The exploration-cycle plugin is designed from the start for repeated-run evaluation.

Early runs capture manual friction notes and outcome summaries to establish a baseline before adding optimization machinery.

The orchestrator is expected to emit or maintain:

- loop-state telemetry
- routing and agent-invocation traces
- handoff and re-entry decisions
- run-level artifact outcomes
- a post-run orchestrator survey

The `exploration-optimizer` skill uses those outputs in a baseline-first, one-hypothesis-at-a-time improvement loop.

## Canonical Artifact Conventions

### The `[NEEDS HUMAN INPUT]` Marker

Every agent and skill in this plugin that generates artifacts uses the following canonical marker for unresolved gaps:

```
[NEEDS HUMAN INPUT]
```

**Format rules (case- and format-sensitive):**
- All uppercase, exactly as written above
- Square brackets, no italics, no variation
- `check_gaps.py` counts this exact string — any variation (lowercase, em-brackets, italic `*[NEEDS HUMAN INPUT]*`) will be silently missed by the gap checker

**When to use it:**
- A required field cannot be filled from existing captures
- An assumption has not been explicitly confirmed by the SME
- A question was raised but not answered during exploration

**Consolidation rule:** Do not scatter this marker without consolidation. Every agent that uses this marker must also maintain a `## Consolidated Gaps` section (or equivalent "Remaining Unknowns") that lists each distinct unresolved decision once. Reference the consolidated entry in other sections rather than repeating the marker.

**Agents that use this marker:** `handoff-preparer-agent`, `requirements-doc-agent`, `planning-doc-agent`, `user-story-capture` skill. When adding a new agent or skill that produces artifacts, link to this section and follow these conventions.

### The `[CONFIRMED]` / `[UNCONFIRMED]` Status Tags

Use these alongside source citations on major claims:
- `[CONFIRMED]` — explicitly validated by the SME during the session
- `[UNCONFIRMED]` — derived from captures but not explicitly approved

Never promote `[UNCONFIRMED]` to `[CONFIRMED]` without explicit SME sign-off in the session.
