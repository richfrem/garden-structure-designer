# File, Namespace, and Class Naming Conventions

> **Note:** For guidance on where to place shared React and .NET code, see [Project Directory Structure Requirements](./project-folder-structure-guidance.md). All shared React code must be in `outputs/common/react/` and all shared .NET code in `outputs/common/dotnet/`.

Consistent naming conventions in .NET and React projects improve readability and maintainability. This guide summarizes best practices for naming files, classes, and namespaces, with recommendations for mixed-language projects.

## 1. File Naming Conventions

### .NET (C#)
- **General Rule:** Use **PascalCase** for file names (e.g., `MyClass.cs`, `UserService.cs`) to match the public class they contain, following Microsoft's C# coding conventions.
- **Exceptions:** Configuration, script, or non-class files (e.g., `appsettings.json`, `Startup.cs`) may use `camelCase` or `kebab-case` (e.g., `my-config.json`) as per team/project standards.
- **Rationale:** PascalCase aligns with class naming and makes it easy to locate files by class name.

### React (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **General Rule:** Use **camelCase** (e.g., `myComponent.js`, `userProfile.tsx`) or **kebab-case** (e.g., `my-component.js`) for file names. **camelCase** is more common in modern React/TypeScript projects.
- **Component Files:** File names often match the component name, which is typically **PascalCase** (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`). However, some projects use `camelCase` for the file (e.g., `myComponent.tsx`) for consistency with other JS files.
- **Rationale:** camelCase/kebab-case aligns with JavaScript ecosystem norms and avoids issues on case-sensitive file systems.

**Recommendation for Mixed Projects:**
- Use **PascalCase** for C# files.
- Use **PascalCase** for React component files (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`) to match component names, and **camelCase** for non-component files (e.g., `useAuthHook.ts`, `apiClient.js`).
- Choose one style for React files and document it for consistency.

## 2. Class Naming Conventions

### .NET (C#)
- **Rule:** Use **PascalCase** for all class names (e.g., `UserService`, `OrderController`).
- **Rationale:** PascalCase distinguishes types from variables/methods (which use camelCase).

### React (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **Rule:** Use **PascalCase** for all classes and React components (e.g., `MyComponent`, `UserModel`).
- **Rationale:** PascalCase is standard for constructor functions and classes, including functional React components.

**Recommendation:** Use **PascalCase** for all classes in both .NET and React/TypeScript.

## 3. Namespace and Directory Naming

### .NET (C#)
- **Rule:** Use **PascalCase** for namespaces (e.g., `MyApp.Services`, `MyApp.Models`).
- **Rationale:** Namespaces are treated like types; PascalCase ensures clarity and consistency.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  namespace MyCompany.MyApp.Services;
  ```

### React (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Rule:** Use **camelCase** or **kebab-case** for directory names (e.g., `components/userProfile`, `components/user-profile`).
- **Note:** JavaScript/TypeScript does not use namespaces like C#; modules (files) and directories serve as organizational units.
- **If using TypeScript namespaces (rare):** Use **PascalCase** (e.g., `namespace MyApp.Utils`).

**Recommendation:**
- Use **PascalCase** for C# namespaces.
- Use **camelCase** or **kebab-case** for React directories. Avoid TypeScript namespaces in favor of ES module imports.

## 4. Best Practices for Mixed .NET and React Projects

- **Consistency:** Agree on conventions upfront and document them (e.g., in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a style guide).
- **Tooling:**
  - .NET: Use EditorConfig or Roslyn analyzers (e.g., `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`).
  - React: Use ESLint/Prettier with rules like `naming-convention` or `filenames/match-exported`.
- **Cross-Language Alignment:**
  - Use **PascalCase** for C# files/classes and React component files.
  - Use **camelCase** for non-component React files.
  - Keep C# namespaces in PascalCase; use camelCase/kebab-case for React directories.
- **File System Considerations:** Avoid ambiguous names (e.g., `mycomponent.tsx` vs. `MyComponent.tsx`) to prevent issues on case-sensitive systems.

## 5. Example Project Structure

```
/MyApp
  /ClientApp (React)
    /components
      MyComponent.tsx   // PascalCase for component file
      useAuthHook.ts    // camelCase for hook file
    /utils
      apiClient.ts      // camelCase for utility file
  /Server (ASP.NET Core)
    /Controllers
      UserController.cs // PascalCase, matches class
    /Services
      OrderService.cs   // PascalCase, matches class
    /Models
      ProductModel.cs   // PascalCase, matches class
```

## 6. Summary Table

| Aspect         | .NET (C#)         | React (JS/TS)                |
| --------------| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| File Names    | PascalCase        | camelCase/PascalCase         |
| Classes       | PascalCase        | PascalCase                   |
| Namespaces    | PascalCase        | camelCase/kebab-case (dirs)  |

- Use **PascalCase** for C# files/classes/namespaces.
- Use **PascalCase** for React component files, **camelCase** for non-component files, and **camelCase/kebab-case** for directories.
- Document and enforce conventions for consistency across the project.
