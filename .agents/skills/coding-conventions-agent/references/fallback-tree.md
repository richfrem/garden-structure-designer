# Procedural Fallback Tree: Coding Conventions

## 1. File Header Template Missing for Language
If a language's header format is not in the skill (e.g., a new language is introduced):
- **Action**: Use the closest existing template as a structural base. Report that no official template exists for the language and ask the user to ratify the adapted template before committing it as the standard.

## 2. Function Exceeds 50-Line Threshold Mid-Implementation
If a function being written grows beyond 50 lines:
- **Action**: STOP adding to the function. Extract the oversized block into a named helper. Resume writing only after the refactor. Do NOT finish the long function and "plan to refactor later."

## 3. New Script Not Registered in tool_inventory.json
If a new script in plugins/ is missing from tool_inventory.json after creation:
- **Action**: Trigger the `tool-inventory` skill to register the script. Do NOT commit the script without the registration. Ask the agent to confirm 0 untracked scripts before staging.

## 4. Ambiguous Naming Convention (Multi-Language File)
If a file or function spans multiple language contexts (e.g., a Python script calling TypeScript-style names from a schema):
- **Action**: Apply the target file's language convention. Report the ambiguity to the user and note which convention was applied. Never mix conventions within a single file.
