# Ecosystem Authoritative Sources

# Official Open Standard Recognition
**Important:** This reference library draws heavy inspiration and structural standards directly from the Anthropic Claude Plugins official repositories. Please refer to:
- **Foundational Specification**: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/plugin-dev`
- **L4 Interaction & Execution Patterns**: Derived from `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-knowledgework-plugins` (specifically the Legal and Bio-Research plugins).
- **Skill Creator 2.0 (Anthropic, March 2026)**: `https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator`
- **Anthropic Official Claude Code docs**: `https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/`

## Agentic OS / Agent Harness Pattern
The Agentic OS is a synthesized runtime environment pattern built from Anthropic primitives:

| Component | Anthropic Primitive | Official URL |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| Project kernel | `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy (5 scopes) | https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory |
| Scheduled tasks | `/loop` command | https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/loop |
| Task specialists | Sub-agents (`.claude/agents/`) | https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents |
| Automation | Hooks (`hooks.json`) | https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks |
| Personal shortcuts | Slash commands (`.claude/commands/`) | https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands |
| Per-project config | Plugin settings (`.claude/*.local.md`) | Anthropic plugin-dev docs |

The `context/` folder structure, `heartbeat.md`, `START_HERE.md`, and memory log patterns
are community conventions built on top of these primitives (not Anthropic-official).

For bootstrapping Agentic OS in a project, use the `agentic-os-init` skill:
```
.agents/skills/agentic-os-init/SKILL.md
```

# The Library
The following open standards are available for review:

This skill provides comprehensive information and reference guides about the conventions and constraints defining the extensibility ecosystem.

Because of the Progressive Disclosure architecture, you should selectively read the reference files below only when you need detailed information on that specific topic.

## Installation

### Claude Plugin Marketplace (Claude Code native — verified 2.1.81+)
Repos with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the root can be registered as a marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace add owner/repo
/plugin install <plugin-name>
```
Claude Code fetches from the default branch. The `marketplace.json` must be merged to `main` before consumers can install.

`/plugin install <name>` opens an **interactive Plugins panel** (not plain stdout) showing plugin details and a scope picker (user / project / local). The command returns no terminal output — UI renders in the panel.

**Source types in marketplace.json:**
- Relative path (same-repo monorepo): `"source": "./plugins/my-plugin"` — resolved from repo root
- Git subdirectory (sparse clone): `"source": { "type": "git-subdir", "url": "...", "subdir": "..." }`
- npm package: `"source": { "type": "npm", "package": "@scope/pkg", "version": "^1.0.0" }`
- Non-GitHub git: `"source": { "type": "url", "url": "...", "ref": "main" }`

**`strict` field:** `true` = plugin's own `plugin.json` wins; `false` = marketplace entry is the full definition (no plugin.json needed).

**Validation before publishing:** `/plugin validate .` or `claude plugin validate .`

**Team/enterprise distribution (`.claude/settings.json`):**
- `extraKnownMarketplaces` — auto-register marketplace for the whole team
- `enabledPlugins` — default-enable specific plugins for all team members
- `strictKnownMarketplaces: true` — lock to approved marketplaces only (enterprise)
- `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_SEED_DIR` env var — pre-populate plugins in containers/CI

Note: `/plugin marketplace browse` returns no content in 2.1.81 — use `/plugin help` to discover available subcommands.

### `npx skills` CLI (cross-agent)
Universal CLI to install across all supported agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini CLI, etc).

**Quick Reference:**
For all installation, update, and management commands, strictly refer to the authoritative project hub:

> ### 👉 [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/richfrem/agent-plugins-skills/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

*This hub contains the definitive logic for `uvx`, `bootstrap.py`, and `npx skills` methods.*

## Anthropic Plugin-Dev Key Learnings (March 2026)
The following patterns were confirmed from Anthropic's official `plugin-dev` plugin:
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Absolute path to the plugin's installation directory (read-only during updates).
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`**: Persistent directory for plugin state (e.g., node_modules, venv) that survives updates.
- **Prompt-based hooks**: LLM-driven hooks run in parallel; use for semantic decisions. Command-based hooks for deterministic validation.
- **`model: inherit`**: Default for sub-agents. Explicitly setting a model pins the agent to a version.
- **`<example>` blocks**: Use 2-4 `<example>` blocks in agent frontmatter descriptions for richer trigger context (including proactive and negative instructions).
- **`.local.md` settings**: Store per-project agent config in `.claude/<plugin-name>.local.md` (always gitignore).
- **`examples/` directory**: Add to skills alongside `references/` for working code samples.
- **SKILL.md target**: 1500-2000 words / under 500 lines. Third-person description, imperative body.
- **Description checklist**: 3-5 triggers, 100-word limit, precise action verbs, 1 negative boundary.

## Usage Instruction
Never guess the specifics of `SKILL.md` frontmatter, plugin directory limits, or workflow sizes. Read the exact specifications linked above before constructing new ecosystem extensions.
