# Skill Evaluation and Testing

## Overview
Skill authors can now leverage software development rigor (testing, benchmarking, iteration) for Agent Skills without writing code. This helps ensure skills work reliably, do not suffer regressions over time, and trigger precisely when needed against evolving models.

## Skill Types & Evaluation Goals
Skills generally fall into two categories, which influence how and why they are evaluated:

1. **Capability Uplift Skills**: Help the base model perform tasks it cannot natively do consistently (e.g., specific document creation patterns).
   - *Eval Purpose*: To monitor when general model capabilities outgrow the skill. Over time, as base models improve, these skills may become obsolete.
2. **Encoded Preference Skills**: Document specific organizational workflows where the model sequences known capabilities according to team processes (e.g., NDA reviews).
   - *Eval Purpose*: To verify the skill's fidelity to the actual ongoing workflow and ensuring durability.

## Core Testing Capabilities

### 1. Evaluations (Evals)
Our PDF skill, for instance, previously struggled with non-fillable forms. Claude had to place text at exact coordinates with no defined fields to guide it. Evals isolated the failure, and we shipped a fix that anchors positioning to extracted text coordinates.

- **Catching Regressions**: Provides early signals if a skill behaves differently after a model architecture or infrastructure update.

### 2. Benchmarking
- Runs standardized assessments using defined evals.
- Tracks metrics such as pass rate, elapsed time, and token usage.
- Enables side-by-side comparison across different models or before/after editing a skill.

### 3. Multi-Agent Evaluation & A/B Testing
- **Parallel Execution**: Spins up independent agents in clean contexts to run evals faster and prevent cross-contamination of context memory.
- **Comparator Agents**: Judges outputs blindly for A/B comparisons: two skill versions, or skill vs. no skill. They judge outputs without knowing which is which, so you can tell whether a change actually helped.

### 4. Description Optimization (Trigger Precision)
- Output quality is irrelevant if a skill does not trigger when requested.
- Analyzes current skill descriptions against sample prompts to reduce false positives (triggering when it shouldn't) and false negatives (failing to trigger when it should).

## The Future of Skills
As foundational models improve, the line between "skill" and "specification" will blur. While today `././SKILL.md` serves as an implementation plan for *how* to do a task, tomorrow's skills may only require a natural language specification of *what* should be done. The current evaluation framework is a stepping stone toward that future.
