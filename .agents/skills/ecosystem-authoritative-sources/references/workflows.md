# Workflows vs. Commands vs. Skills

This document traces the historical evolution of custom slash commands into the current open standard for Agent Skills, and specifically calls out how different agent ecosystems refer to specific task-runner routines (like *Workflows* in Antigravity or Roo Code).

## The Triad of Constraints: When to use What?
When extending an agent, you must choose the right architectural layer to avoid redundant commands or ignored instructions.

### 1. Passive Rules (`rules/*.mdc`)
**Use when**: You need the agent to follow strict, always-on stylistic or structural constraints without the user ever asking.
- **Example**: Coding conventions, syntax preferences, strictly forbidden legacy API usages. 
- **Why**: You shouldn't need a `/apply-conventions` command. The IDE should automatically apply your conventions on every single file it generates via global prompt injection.

### 2. Autonomous Skills (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)
**Use when**: The agent needs procedural knowledge or sub-routines that it can decide to trigger on its own contextually.
- **Example**: Querying a database, running a test suite, generating a mermaid diagram, scaffolding a directory.
- **Why**: The LLM reads the frontmatter `description` and seamlessly chooses to use the skill *only* when the current phase of work demands it, preventing prompt bloat.

### 3. Explicit User Commands (`commands/*.md` or `workflows/*.md`)
**Use when**: The user explicitly demands full control over the initiation of a massive operation or workflow.
- **Example**: `/deploy-production`, `/onboard-new-epic`, `/sync-rlm-cache`.
- **Why**: These are for operations you *never* want the agent to trigger autonomously. The user deliberately forces execution via a `/` slash command in the chat UI.

## The Evolution of `/commands` into Skills

In early versions of Agentic environments (such as older versions of Claude Code), users extended capability using a simple directory approach (e.g. `.claude/commands/`).
- Putting a file at `.claude/commands/review.md` would automatically create the `/review` slash command for the user to invoke.
  
**The Merge into Agent Skills:**
Custom slash commands have since been merged into the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io).
- Legacy `.claude/commands/` files continue to execute seamlessly.
- **Location Nuance:** Skills can be deployed in both the `skills/` and `commands/` directories.
  - If placed in `skills/`, the directory name becomes the slash command AND the skill triggers
    autonomously via the LLM reading the `description` frontmatter. **This is the recommended
    location for new slash commands in Claude Code.**
  - If a skill is placed in `commands/`, it explicitly allows manual invocation via a `/`
    slash-command, but relies less on autonomous discovery.
  - **macOS discovery bug (#13906):** `.claude/commands/` has a known discovery issue in some
    Claude Code versions on macOS. Prefer `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or a local plugin
    for reliable slash command registration.
  - In a plugin, any `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` entry is deployed to `.claude/skills/<name>/`
    and automatically namespaced as `/plugin-name:name` — functioning as both a proactive
    skill and an explicitly invocable slash command.

## Antigravity Rules and Workflows
For platforms like **Antigravity** (Google Deepmind's agent framework), these repeatable systems are officially documented as **Rules** and **Workflows**.

### Rules
Rules provide models with persistent, reusable constraints and context at the prompt level. They are manually defined constraints to help the agent follow behaviors specific to your stack and style.
- **Global Rules:** Saved to `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (applied across all workspaces).
- **Workspace Rules:** Saved to `.agent/rules/` within your workspace/git root.
- **Size Limit:** Each Rule file is strictly limited to **12,000 characters maximum**.

**Activation Triggers:**
Rules can be defined to activate in four ways:
1. **Manual:** Activated manually via `@` mention.
2. **Always On:** Unconditionally applied to prompt context.
3. **Model Decision:** Provide a natural language description, and the model autonomously decides if it applies.
4. **Glob:** A glob pattern (e.g., `.js`, `src/**/*.ts`) causes the rule to automatically apply to matched files.

**File Includes:**
Rules support `@filename` includes. Relative paths are resolved relative to the Rules file. Absolute paths are resolved as true absolutes; otherwise, they resolve relative to the repository root.

### Workflows
While *Rules* provide context, **Workflows** provide a structured sequence of steps or prompts at the *trajectory level*. They guide the model through interconnected actions (like deploying a service or closing PRs).
- **Format:** Workflows are Markdown files containing a title, a description, and a series of steps (often leveraging `// turbo` tags to auto-run CLI actions).
- **Storage:** Saved locally to `.agents/workflows/` or globally as specified.
- **Size Limit:** Each Workflow file is strictly limited to **12,000 characters maximum**.
- **Execution:** Invoked directly as slash commands (e.g., `/workflow-name`). Workflows can also recursively call *other* workflows by including instructions like "Call /workflow-2".

## Convergence
Whether checking `.agents/workflows/[name].md` for Antigravity, or parsing `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md` for Claude Code, the end goal is identical: **providing agents with reusable, deterministically structured procedural knowledge so they don't have to guess how your environment operates.**
