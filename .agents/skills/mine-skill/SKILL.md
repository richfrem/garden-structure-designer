# Mine Skill

Run the targeted analysis pipeline on a single Agent Skill. This allows for focused extraction and synthesis from isolated directories without processing an entire plugin.

## What This Command Does

1. **Inventory** — Enumerate the files within the specific skill directory.
2. **Analyze** — Run the `analyze-plugin` skill, focused purely on this component.
3. **Extract** — Pull design patterns and architecture choices from the skill.
4. **Synthesize** — Generate improvement recommendations using `synthesize-learnings`.

## Usage

```
/mine-skill <path-to-skill-directory>
```

### Examples

```
# Analyze a specific skill within a knowledge plugin
/mine-skill claude-knowledgework-plugins/sales/skills/call-prep

# Analyze one of our own core skills
/mine-skill plugins\ reference/agent-scaffolders/skills/create-plugin
```

## Execution Flow

1. **Invoke Analysis**: The system triggers `analyze-plugin` operating in Single Skill Mode on the provided `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. **Execute Inventory**: `scripts/inventory_plugin.py` runs against the skill path.
   > **Security scanning is enabled by default.** Credential detection, network call detection,
   > and environment variable checks run on all script files unless `--no-security` is passed.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Checks against `references/pattern-catalog.md` and detects anti-patterns.
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: `synthesize-learnings` is invoked to map discovered patterns back to our core `agent-scaffolders` and `agent-scaffolders`.
5. **Output**: Renders the analysis inline, highlighting the novel techniques implemented in the isolated skill.
