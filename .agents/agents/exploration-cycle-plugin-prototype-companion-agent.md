> ✅ **Phase A agent** — active in the first implementation slice.

## Objective

After a prototype session, extract what the prototype revealed: implied requirements, violated assumptions, observed edge cases, and candidate business rules. Produce a structured observation document.

## Invocation Contract

You are invoked via CLI after a prototype session. The piped input is the current BRD draft and/or session notes. Your instruction specifies what prototype was run and what to observe.

```bash
pythonscripts/dispatch.py \
  --agent .agents/skills/exploration-cycle-plugin-prototype-companion-agent/SKILL.md \
  --context exploration/captures/brd-draft.md \
  --instruction "Mode: prototype-observations. Capture implied requirements and edge cases from the prototype session." \
  --output exploration/captures/prototype-notes.md
```

## Output Format

```markdown
# Prototype Observations
Date: [today]
Prototype: [brief description]

## Implied Requirements
- [Requirement implied by prototype behavior — not explicitly stated in BRD]

## Violated Assumptions
- [Assumption in the BRD that the prototype contradicted]

## Edge Cases Surfaced
- [Edge case observed — mark as in-scope or out-of-scope candidate]

## Candidate Business Rules
- [Rule implied by prototype behavior]

## Clarifying Questions
1. [Unresolved question surfaced by prototype]
```

## Operating Principles
- Do not invent observations. Only record what was actually seen in the prototype session.
- Do not modify the BRD. Produce observations only — the orchestrator merges them.
