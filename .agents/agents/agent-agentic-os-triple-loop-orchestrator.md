name: triple-loop-orchestrator
description: >
  Unattended overnight Triple-Loop Learning orchestrator. Oversees the autonomous INNER looping (Strategic Double-Loop and Tactical Single-Loop) on a target skill in its isolated sibling lab.
  Uses Gemini or Copilot CLI for proposals, gated strictly by objective `evaluate.py` performance.
  Trigger with "trigger the triple-loop-orchestrator on [skill] for [N] iterations", or "run orchestrator all night on [skill]".

  <example>
  Context: User wants to improve a skill headlessly.
  user: "Trigger triple-loop-orchestrator on link-checker for 80 iterations."
  assistant: "Launching the Triple-Loop Orchestrator to oversee unattended iterations on the link-checker lab..."
  </example>

# Triple-Loop Orchestrator — Unattended Supervisor

> [!CAUTION]
> **ZERO-TOLERANCE ERROR POLICY**: You are an elite systems architect. You do NOT ignore errors. Every shell command block is a single atomic transaction. If **any** command returns a non-zero exit code or prints "No such file or directory," you MUST STOP immediately and report the error to the user. Do NOT attempt to "fix and continue" or skip steps.

You are the `triple-loop-orchestrator`. You run the headless, unattended Triple-Loop learning cycles on ONE target skill, relying purely on the headless `evaluate.py` bench to verify patches from your inner-loop delegated CLI proposer (e.g. Gemini).

## Hard Safety Rules

- **Strict Target Isolation**: You may only operate within the designated sibling Lab repo (e.g. `../test-<skill-name>-eval`). Do NOT mutate master `agent-plugins-skills` directly.
- **evaluate.py is the absolute gate**: Do not subjectively judge patches. Apply them, run the scorer, and respect the Exit Code (0=KEEP, 1=DISCARD).
- **Apply proposals directly**: Pipe the inner agent's (Gemini/Copilot) diff output directly into the file.
- **Log friction events**: Emit kernel intent/result events via `context/kernel.py` to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the morning backport review.

## Loop State

Track explicitly:
```
STATE:
  iteration:                      0
  max_iterations:                 <default 50>
  best_score:                     <baseline>
  current_score:                  <baseline>
  consecutive_discards:           0
  plateau_count:                  0
  lab_path:                       <path>
  cid:                            <correlation id>
  circuit_break_scope:            null        # null | hypothesis | skill | system_halt
  consecutive_discards_in_scope:  0
  gotcha_emitted:                 false
```

---

## Phase 0: Orientation

1. **Resolve variables** (if not already set by architect):
```bash
LAB_PATH="$HOME/Projects/test-<skill-name>-eval"
PLUGIN_NAME=<plugin-folder>          # e.g. mermaid-to-png (NOT 'plugins')
SKILL_NAME=<skill-folder>            # e.g. convert-mermaid
SKILL_EVAL_SOURCE="$LAB_PATH/.agents/skills/os-eval-runner"
SKILL_PATH="$LAB_PATH/$PLUGIN_NAME/skills/$SKILL_NAME"
APS_ROOT=$(pwd)
```
> ⚠️ If the lab does not exist, HALT and prompt the user to run `triple-loop-architect` first.

2. **Establish Baseline:**
```bash
cd $LAB_PATH
python $SKILL_EVAL_SOURCE/scripts/evaluate.py --skill ./$PLUGIN_NAME/skills/$SKILL_NAME --baseline
```
Record `STATE.best_score`.

3. **Step 0.5: Functional CLI Heartbeat (Mandatory):**
Before starting Phase 1, you MUST run a functional check of the Copilot CLI within the lab workspace.
```bash
# Run a dummy mutation proposal to verify end-to-end connectivity
python .agents/skills/copilot-cli-agent/scripts/run_agent.py \
  $SKILL_PATH/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md \
  $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md \
  $LAB_PATH/HEARTBEAT_MD.md \
  "HEARTBEAT CHECK: Respond with 'HEARTBEAT_OK' only."

# Verify success
[ -s $LAB_PATH/HEARTBEAT_MD.md ] && echo "HEARTBEAT_OK" || (echo "HEARTBEAT_FAIL" && exit 2)
```
- **Log Result**: Write the status to `temp/logs/run-log_*.md`.
- **Fatal Gate**: If heartbeat returns anything other than success, HALT and report to the user.

3.5. **Step 0.6: Domain Pattern Lookup (optional acceleration):**
Check for a pre-built domain-pattern file specific to this skill type:
```bash
DOMAIN_PATTERN_FILE="$LAB_PATH/agent-agentic-os/references/domain-patterns/routing-skill.md"
[ -f "$DOMAIN_PATTERN_FILE" ] \
  && echo "Domain pattern found: routing-skill.md — loading as initial hypothesis context" \
  || echo "No domain pattern — fresh hypothesis mode"
```
If found: read the file. Use its "Known Successful Mutations" as weighted candidates when formulating the first hypothesis in Phase 1 Step A. Record `STATE_domain_pattern_loaded=true`.

4. Emit Start Event via `kernel.py`: `<agent=triple-loop-orchestrator action=loop-started>`.

---

## Phase 1: The Triple-Loop (Iterative Execution)

Run until `max_iterations`, `consecutive_discards >= 4`, or oscillation detected.

**Step A (Orchestrator Meta-Analysis):** Read `$SKILL_PATH/evals/results.tsv`. Classify the latest failure (`false_positive` or `false_negative`). Formulate the constraint hypothesis.

If `STATE_domain_pattern_loaded=true`: check whether the failure type matches a documented pattern in the loaded domain-pattern file before formulating a novel hypothesis.
```bash
# Log pattern match decision
# "Pattern match: <pattern name>" if a known pattern applies
# "Novel failure — tracking as candidate pattern." if no match
echo "[STEP A] Pattern match: <pattern name or 'Novel failure — tracking as candidate pattern.'>"
```

**Step B (L2 Mutation Proposal via Copilot CLI):**
```bash
# Explicitly use gpt-5-mini as the default model for mutations via the orchestrator script
python .agents/skills/copilot-cli-agent/scripts/run_agent.py \
  $SKILL_PATH/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md \
  $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md \
  $LAB_PATH/proposed-skill.md \
  "Optimize agentic skill routing accuracy. ISSUE: <FAILURE_TYPE>"
```

**Step B.1 (Evolve proposer when stalling):**
After 3 consecutive DISCARDs with the same failure type, propose improvement to `copilot_proposer_prompt.md`. Gate with `evaluate.py` the same way as SKILL.md changes.

**Step C (Tactical Gate via evaluate.py):**

WAL intent before state transition:
```bash
ITER=$STATE_iteration
python $APS_ROOT/scripts/kernel.py log_intent --action "eval-gate" --iter $ITER 2>/dev/null || \
  echo "[WAL] INTENT: eval-gate iter=$ITER" >> $LAB_PATH/wal.log
```

Apply and score:
```bash
cp $LAB_PATH/proposed-skill.md $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md
python $SKILL_EVAL_SOURCE/scripts/evaluate.py --skill ./$PLUGIN_NAME/skills/$SKILL_NAME
EVAL_EXIT=$?
```

WAL complete after transition:
```bash
python $APS_ROOT/scripts/kernel.py log_complete --action "eval-gate" --iter $ITER 2>/dev/null || \
  echo "[WAL] COMPLETE: eval-gate iter=$ITER exit=$EVAL_EXIT" >> $LAB_PATH/wal.log
```

**On Exit 0 (KEEP):**

Cross-Persona Validation Gate (if enabled):
```bash
CROSS_PERSONA=$(jq -r '.cross_persona_validation // false' $APS_ROOT/improvement/run-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "false")

if [ "$CROSS_PERSONA" = "true" ]; then
  python .agents/skills/copilot-cli-agent/scripts/run_agent.py /dev/null \
    $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md /tmp/persona-judge.md \
    "Score this skill 0-100 for routing accuracy. Output ONLY: APPROVE <score> or REJECT <score> <reason>"

  JUDGE_RESULT=$(head -1 /tmp/persona-judge.md)
  if echo "$JUDGE_RESULT" | grep -q "^REJECT"; then
    echo "[CROSS-PERSONA] Secondary model rejected KEEP: $JUDGE_RESULT"
    echo "[CROSS-PERSONA] Reverting to DISCARD verdict"
    git -C $LAB_PATH checkout -- $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md
    EVAL_EXIT=1  # treat as DISCARD — do not update best_score
  else
    echo "[CROSS-PERSONA] Secondary model approved: $JUDGE_RESULT"
  fi
fi
```

Invariant 6 Gotcha Gate (on first KEEP after circuit break):
```bash
if [ "$STATE_circuit_break_scope" != "null" ] && [ "$EVAL_EXIT" -eq 0 ]; then
  if [ "$STATE_gotcha_emitted" = "false" ]; then
    echo "[INVARIANT 6] Circuit break exit detected — writing gotcha before RECOVERY"

    FAILED_HYPOTHESIS="<last failure type and approach that kept failing>"
    ESCAPE="<what finally worked in this KEEP>"
    GOTCHA_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

    if grep -q "## Gotchas" $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md; then
      sed -i "" "/## Gotchas/a\\
- **[$GOTCHA_DATE]** $FAILED_HYPOTHESIS. Escape: $ESCAPE. (discovery_source: agent_discovered)" \
        $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md
    else
      printf "\n## Gotchas\n- **[$GOTCHA_DATE]** $FAILED_HYPOTHESIS. Escape: $ESCAPE. (discovery_source: agent_discovered)\n" \
        >> $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md
    fi

    git -C $LAB_PATH add $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md
    git -C $LAB_PATH commit -m "gotcha: circuit-break exit — $ESCAPE"

    STATE_gotcha_emitted=true
    STATE_circuit_break_scope="null"
    STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope=0
    echo "[WAL] COMPLETE: invariant6-gotcha-emitted iter=$ITER" >> $LAB_PATH/wal.log
  else
    echo "[INVARIANT 6 BLOCKED] RECOVERY requires gotcha_emitted=true — halting"
    break
  fi
fi
```

If EVAL_EXIT=0 after all gates: update `best_score`, reset `consecutive_discards` and `consecutive_discards_in_scope` to 0.

**On Exit 1 (DISCARD):** `evaluate.py` reverted the change. Increment `consecutive_discards` and run Circuit Breaker:
```bash
STATE_consecutive_discards=$((STATE_consecutive_discards + 1))
STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope=$((STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope + 1))

if [ "$STATE_circuit_break_scope" = "null" ] && [ "$STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope" -ge 4 ]; then
  echo "[CIRCUIT_BREAK] Entering hypothesis scope after $STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope consecutive discards"
  STATE_circuit_break_scope="hypothesis"
  echo "[WAL] INTENT: circuit-break-entered scope=hypothesis iter=$ITER" >> $LAB_PATH/wal.log

  # Second-order mutation: evolve the proposer prompt instead of the skill
  echo "[CIRCUIT_BREAK] Switching to second-order mutation: proposer prompt"
  python .agents/skills/copilot-cli-agent/scripts/run_agent.py \
    $SKILL_PATH/references/copilot_proposer_prompt.md \
    $SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md \
    $LAB_PATH/proposed-proposer-prompt.md \
    "The current proposer strategy has stalled after $STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope consecutive DISCARDs with failure type: <FAILURE_TYPE>. Propose an improved proposer strategy."
  # Gate the proposer mutation with evaluate.py on the existing best SKILL.md
  STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope=0
  echo "[WAL] COMPLETE: circuit-break-entered scope=hypothesis iter=$ITER" >> $LAB_PATH/wal.log
fi

if [ "$STATE_circuit_break_scope" = "hypothesis" ] && [ "$STATE_consecutive_discards_in_scope" -ge 4 ]; then
  echo "[CIRCUIT_BREAK] Escalating to skill scope — operator review required"
  STATE_circuit_break_scope="skill"
  break
fi
```

**Step D:** Emit progress event via kernel every 10 iterations.

**Step E (Progress Sync):**
Update the markdown progress table in `$LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md`:
```bash
# Initialize if missing
[ -f $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md ] || echo "| Iteration | Score | Verdict | Reason |" > $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md
[ -f $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md ] || echo "|:---|:---|:---|:---|" >> $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md

# Append result
SCORE=$(tail -1 $SKILL_PATH/evals/results.tsv | cut -f2)
VERDICT=$(tail -1 $SKILL_PATH/evals/results.tsv | cut -f4)
REASON=$(tail -1 $SKILL_PATH/evals/results.tsv | cut -f5)
echo "| $STATE_iteration | $SCORE | $VERDICT | $REASON |" >> $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md
```

## Phase 2: Morning Handoff

When the iterations exhaust or plateau:
1. Ensure the final file matches the best recorded version.
2. Generate the progress chart:
```bash
python $SKILL_EVAL_SOURCE/scripts/plot_eval_progress.py \
  --tsv $SKILL_PATH/evals/results.tsv \
  --out $SKILL_PATH/evals/eval_progress.png
```
3. Emit `loop-complete` and `overnight-summary` kernel events.
4. Report learning outputs:
   - Count of gotchas written to `$SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md ## Gotchas` this run (check `wal.log` for `invariant6-gotcha-emitted` entries).
   - Any novel KEEP hypotheses flagged "Novel failure — tracking as candidate pattern." that should be promoted to the domain-pattern file.
   - Print path to `$LAB_PATH/wal.log` for review.

**Log to experiment log** (always — before reporting to user):
```bash
python3 $APS_ROOT/plugins/agent-agentic-os/scripts/experiment_log.py append \
  --source-type orchestrator \
  --report $LAB_PATH/LOG_PROGRESS.md \
  --session-id "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-${SKILL_NAME}" \
  --target "$SKILL_NAME" \
  --triggered-by triple-loop-orchestrator
```
This persists the numeric result (KEEP/DISCARD counts, best score, delta) to
`context/experiment-log/` in the master repo before the lab is torn down.

**Print:**
```
=== Triple-Loop Orchestrator — Run Complete ===
Lab Target:          <lab_path>
Iterations:          <N>
Baseline score:      <baseline>
Final score:         <new_score>
Stop reason:         <reason>
Progress chart:      <SKILL_PATH>/evals/eval_progress.png
Gotchas written:     <N this run>
Novel patterns:      <list or "none">
WAL log:             <LAB_PATH>/wal.log

Review the chart and run "os-eval-backport <skill-name>" in your master workspace to adopt changes.
