description: Interactively package project files into a Markdown (.md) or ZIP archive.

Follow the `context-bundler` skill workflow to package project context for sharing.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS` — optional target directory, specific files, or a brief scope description (e.g., "auth logic") to seed the discovery phase.

## Steps

1. **Phase 1: Discovery** — If `$ARGUMENTS` is vague, ask targeted questions to confirm the specific directories/files and the desired output format (.md or .zip).
2. **Phase 2: Recap & Confirm** — Present a proposed "Context Bundle Plan" listing the files and format. Wait for user approval.
3. **Phase 3: Build Manifest** — Formulate the `file-manifest.json` using recursive directory paths where possible.
4. **Phase 4: Execute & Handoff** — Invoke `bundle.py` (for .md) or `bundle_zip.py` (for .zip) using the created manifest.
5. Report the generated bundle path and provide instructions for use (e.g., copy/paste for Markdown).

## Output

A single file: either a structured Markdown document (`.md`) containing the source code and metadata, or a compressed Archive (`.zip`) for portability.

## Edge Cases

- **Token Limits:** If the target scope is too large for a single Markdown bundle, suggest splitting it or switching to ZIP.
- **Large Directories:** Use directory-level paths in the manifest instead of individual file entries to stay efficient.
- **Exclusions:** Respect `.gitignore` and common noise patterns (node_modules, .git).
